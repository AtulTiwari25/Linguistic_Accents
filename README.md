# Linguistic_Accents 🎙️  
A Real-Time Accent Detection Application using Machine Learning and Audio Processing

Linguistic_Accents is a Python-based web application that detects and classifies different linguistic accents from voice recordings. It leverages powerful audio processing libraries and machine learning algorithms to analyze `.wav` files and predict accent types in real time. The app features a clean interface built using Streamlit, making it user-friendly for both technical and non-technical users.
